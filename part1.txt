Answer the following, add your answer below each question:
Q1-a) How many lines were added, how many lines were deleted in the commit 4035?
	only 1 line was added. The other 2 lines were modified. 2 lines are showing
	as red and 3 are showing as green. 
	Therefore, 3 insertions and 2 deletions

Q1-b) Copy and paste below the lines that were added?
	+  var frameInterval = 25; (added)
	+  var mainLoopId = setInterval(mainLoop, frameInterval); (modified)
	+ mainLoopId = setInterval(mainLoop, frameInterval); (modified)
	

Q1-c) Copy and paste below the lines that were deleted?
	-  var mainLoopId = setInterval(mainLoop, 25); (modified)
	-  mainLoopId = setInterval(mainLoop, 10); (modified)


Q2) Copy and paste the names of the branches in this repo?
	- master
	- coins
	- origin/head

Q3) Copy and paste the ID of the latest commit that saved changes in all three files:

Q4-a) Assuming a repository has several commits, a developer made some changes to the file named file1.txt

	git diff --staged

Q4-b) Continuing with the above assumption, the developer made more changes without staging the file,
what is the command to compare the changes between the staging area and the working directory?
	git diff
